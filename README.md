# MyTag-Converter-GUI

GUI for [MyTag-Converter](https://github.com/ProfessorCheeseburger/MyTag-Converter), a script to read and categorize MyTag data written by Rekordbox to a files comment field, store categorized MyTag info in an XML, and write MyTags to other fields in the files metadata

## Features

- **Easy to use GUI**: No need to futz around with python and config files
- **Automatically Parse and Categorize MyTags**: Automatically parses and categorizes the unorganized list of MyTags that Rekorbox writes to a songs Comments tag
- **Write Tags to the Files Metadata or a Rekorbox Library XML**: Able to write the tag categories to the specified fields in the files metadata or write them to the specified attributes in Rekorbox's XML format (including ones that are only stored in Rekordbox's database and not the file metadata like Lyricist. Remixer, etc.)
- **Multiple Ways to Scan**: The script can either comb through a specified directory where your music files are contained or it can parse an exported XML of your Rekordbox library and only check tracks that are in your library regardless of file location
- **Metadata Writing**: Currently only supports FLAC and MP3 files

## Installation

Everything has been compiled into a single executable that can be grabbed from the releases section and ran as is. A new config file will be generated once you start adding paths or open the MyTag Window.

## Usage
###Main Window

1. **Rekordbox XML Path**: The path to your Rekordbox Collection exported in XML format. This can be generated by going to `File -> Export collection in xml format` in Rekordbox. This setting is useful as it only scans for files that have been imported into your collection instead of all files in a directory and they can be located anywhere on your computer. Only used if `Use Rekordbox XML` is enabled.
2. **Music Directory Path**: The path to the directory where the music you would like to be scanned is located. Walks the entire directory and all sub directories looking for files in .flac or .mp3 format (these are currently the only two formats supported). Not used if `Use Rekordbox XML` is enabled.
3. **MyTags Database XML Path**: The path and filename you would like used for the XML file that is generated containing your categorized MyTags and the associated filepath for the song. If only a filename is specified the file will be generated in the directory containing the program.
4. **Tag Delimiter**: Delimiter used to separate multiple tags in the same category. Include any desired whitespace (e.g. using "/" will separate tags like "House/Deep House/Dubstep" and using " / " will separate tags like "House / Deep House / Dubstep).
5. **Use Rekordbox XML**: Enable to use a Rekordbox XML to search for all songs/filepaths contained in your collection and extract tags from these
6. **MyTags**: Opens MyTags window where you can set the names for your categories, the MyTags associated with each category, and what fields you want that category of tags to be saved to in the files metadata and the tracks attributes in your Rekordbox XML (if `Use Rekordbox XML` is enabled).
7. **Run Script**: Extracts the MyTags Rekordbox has written to the tracks comment field, categorizes them, generates and XML, and then writes each category of MyTag to the specified fields in the files metadata (and your Rekordbox Collection XML if `Use Rekordbox XML` is enabled)

###MyTag Window

1. **Category Tabs:** Tabs for each of the four MyTag categories that Rekordbox allows you to set
2. **Category:** The category name as you have it in Rekordbox (Genre, Situation, Mood, etc.)
3. **Tags**: The MyTags that are associated with that category in Rekordbox, separated by comma. The program cross references the tags it finds in the files comment section with these to categorize them as they are in Rekordbox.
4. **Rekordbox Field**: If `Use Rekordbox XML` is enabled this the attribute field in the songs \<TRACK> element in your Rekordbox XML that the tags in this category will be written to. Note that some of these attributes like Remixer and Lyricist are only stored in the Rekordbox's database and aren't in the files metadata. This can be useful if you don't want to overwrite already filled in fields in the files metadata but still want the MyTags for the song stored somewhere in the database.
5. **Metadata Field**: The field in the files FLAC or MP3 metadata that the tags in this category will be written to. **THIS WILL OVERWRITE ALL OTHER INFORMATION IN THE METADATA FIELD. ALWAYS HAVE BACKUPS AND RUN TESTS WHEN MASS EDITING FILES.**
6. **Save**: Saves settings for the category to `config.json`

## Notes about ID3 Tags/Metadata

ID3 tags for MP3 are stored and written as 4 character Tag IDs. In the interest of simplicity and not needing to specify separate MP3 and FLAC metadata fields, I have mapped the common ones to their appropriate ID3 codes. 
### Currently supported fields:
`ARTIST`
`ALBUM`
`TITLE`
`GENRE`
`COMMENT`
`COMPOSER`
`LABEL` (Maps to Publisher in MP3 ID3 tags)
`LYRICIST`[^1]
`LANGUAGE`[^1]

Here is a [list](https://www.exiftool.org/TagNames/ID3.html) of ID3 tag codes. If you exclusively use MP3 for your collection you can specify any 4 character ID3 Tag ID under `Metadata Field`and the script will write the tags to that field.

### Custom Metadata Fields

It is possible to store the MyTag info in custom user defined metadata fields if desired. Please note that as far as I'm aware no DJ software is currently able to read/search custom fields.

If the file is MP3 and the specified field is not a 4 character ID3 Tag Code or a value that is supported to map to one, then the tags will be entered under the user defined text field (TXXX) using the field name for the description (different from the text value where the tags will be stored)

If the file is FLAC and the specified field is not a valid recognized metadata field a custom field will be created containing the tags
